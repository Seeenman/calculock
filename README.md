# CalcuLock
CalcuLock is an iPhone app that blocks apps of your choice for a duration of time chosen by the user. The only way to unblock your apps before the time you chose is to solve a calculus problem. 

Features:
- Create multiple different categories so that you can easily block different groups of apps. 
- Set schedules to automatically start and stop blocking apps.
- Set daily time limits on apps after which the app is blocked.
